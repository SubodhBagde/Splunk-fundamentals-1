# Basic Searching

- Splunk has a robust search functionality which enables you to search the entire data set that is ingested. This feature is accessed through the app named as Search & Reporting.

- Combining Search Terms - We can combine the terms used for searching by writing them one after another but putting the user search strings under double quotes.

- Using Wild Card - We can use wild cards in our search option combined with the AND/OR operators.

- Refining Search Results - We can further refine the search result by selecting a string and adding it to the search.

- Use the Timeline

- Work with events -

    * Event types: Event types are categorization system to help you to make sense of your data. Event types let you shift through huge amount of data, find similar patterns, and create alerts and reports.
 
    * An event type represents a search that returns a specific type of event or a useful collection of events. Every event that can be returned by the search gets an association with that event type.
 
- Control a search job -

    * Each time you run a search, create a pivot, open a report or load a dashboard panel, the Splunk software create a job in the system. When you run a search, you are creating an ad hoc search. Pivots, reports and panels are powered by saved searches.
 
    * A job is a process that tracks information about the ad hoc search or saved search. The information that is tracked includes the owner of the job, the app that the job runs on, how many events were returned, and how long it took to run.
